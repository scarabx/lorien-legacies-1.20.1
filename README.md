# About

This mod is based on the sci-fi book series of the same name by Pittacus Lore. By some it is also referred to as I Am Number Four. It's about 9 superpowered alien teenagers, Garde, that escaped from their planet, Lorien, when it was destroyed by the Mogadorians. They were bestowed Legacies which grant them superhuman abilities and sent to earth to prevent the Mogadorians from doing the same to earth.

## Manual

### Legacies

Superhuman abilities bestowed by the lifeforce (The Entity) of the destroyed planet, Lorien.

When the player is stressed because of low health, drowning, getting poisoned, getting surrounded by enemies or losing a pet, there is a 33% chance that a random Legacy will be bestowed upon the player. A 5 minute cooldown before you can get another Legacy is activated after Legacy Bestowal.

Stress is accumulative and Legacy Bestowal only happens 33% of the time when stress points reach 100 or more. Stress decreases when sleeping, eating, being safe and at full health. Stress resets on death or when reaching a maximum of 150.

**Legacy abilities are triggered with a radial menu which is opened with R key.
Radial Menu pages are cycled with shift key while the radial menu is open.** Fireball and Iceball Throwing, Sturma Lightning Strike and Telekinesis Push, Pull and Move are activated by the radial menu and triggered by left-click (Fireball, Iceball and Sturma Lightning Strike) or right-click (Telekinesis Pull and Push). **Right-click and left-click abilities automatically cancel each other out when selected. Non right-click and left-click abilities can be used simultaneously and right-click and left-click abilities can also be used simultaneously.**

**REFER TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE FOR TLDR**

When low on health, player is effected constantly with 10 seconds of Stamina followed by 5 seconds of Tired, during Tired, player can't use his Legacies, this system simulates how Garde lose control of their Legacies when badly hurt.

**Possible Legacies:**

- **Lumen:**
  Pyrokinesis. Includes abilities, Fireball Throwing
  (activated via the radial menu and triggered by left-click),
  Self-ignition (activated via the radial menu), Flaming Hands
  (activated via the radial menu and triggered by hitting your
  target) and Fire resistance (passive).
  When on fire, hitting your target will ignite it.
  Lumen abilities are located on page 1, titled Combat, in
  the radial menu.


- **Glacen:**
  Cryokinesis. Includes abilities, Iceball Throwing
  (activated via the radial menu and triggered by left-click),
  Icicles Creation (ativated via the radial menu and triggered by
  hitting your target), Freeze Water (activated via radial
  menu) and Freezing Hands (activated via the radial menu and
  triggered by hitting your target).
  Glacen abilities except Freeze Water are located on page 1,
  titled Combat, in the radial menu. Freeze Water is located
  on page 4, titled Utility.


- **Telekinesis:**
  Includes abilities, Push, Pull and Move. Push and Pull are activated via the radial menu
  and triggered by right-clicking while looking at target. **Can't be used at the same
  time, Push and Pull automatically remove each other.** Move is activated via the radial
  menu and used by looking at target and target will follow your look direction.
  Telekinesis abilities is located on page 1, titled Combat, in the radial menu.


- **Pondus:**
  Density alteration. Includes abilities, Intangibility and Impenetrable Skin with the
  added benefits of being invincible during Intangibility and near-invincible and strong
  during Impenetrable Skin. Intangibility and Impenetrable Skin are activated via the radial
  menu (page 3, Defense). When only Impenetrable Skin or both Impenetrable Skin and
  Intangibility is active, projectiles bounce off you and when only Intangibility is
  active, projectiles pass through you.


  When Intangibility is active while inside blocks, you can fly (slow and upright). When
  exiting blocks, a 5 second flight grace period starts wherein you can safely turn off
  Intangibility. When Intangifly (activated via radial menu and located on page 2,
  titled Movement, in the radial menu) is active, you can fly with Avex (superman
  pose & at high speed) while Intangibility is active, meaning you can fly through solid
  blocks unimpeded.


  Don't fly through water in this state or your Avex and Intangibility
  will bug out. Don't log out in this state or you will fall for enternity.
  To successfully use Intangifly, enable abilities in the order of Avex, Intangifly and
  Intangibility. If you accidentally fly through water or log out while Intangibility
  and Avex flight is active, fix it by turning off Intangifly & unsneaking.


- **Avex:**
  Superman pose flying at high speed with the added benefit of slow falling. Triggered
  via holding sneak or toggling sneak if sneak toggle is turned on in accessibility and
  jumping once. Once in air, keep holding sneak until you want to stop flying if sneak
  toggle is turned off, if on, you only need to press again if you want to stop flying.
  Flight automatically stops when touching the ground. Flight can only be activated
  while standing still.


- **Accelix:**
  Superspeed, activated via sprinting. Speeds the player up in water too.

  or underground.


- **Regeneras:**
  Automatically heals you to full health when you are low on health.


- **Submari:**
  Underwater breathing, activated when submerged in water.


- **Sturma:**
  Control the weather. Weather control uses a cycle system
  that you have to press in a specific order and that is
  dependent on specific weather conditions. You can only
  conjure rain when it is clear, you can only conjure thunder
  when it is raining and only conjure clear weather when it
  is thundering. For this to work the pressing order should be Rain, Thunder and Clear. Weather control options can be found on page 4, titled Utility, in the radial menu. Strike your foes with lightning, activated via the radial menu (page 1, titled Combat) and triggered by left-clicking while looking at target. **Can't be used at the same time as other left-click abilities, when activating Lightning Strike, other left-click abilities are automatically removed.**

### Inhibitors:

Inhibitor arrow effects target player with Active Legacy Inhibition effect, which lasts for 5 seconds, disables Legacies' abilities and effects the player with nausea, slowness and weakness. Based on shock collar crossbows from the second Lorien Legacies book series, Lorien Legacies Reborn.

When you hit another player with an Inhibitor item, a brain-implanted chip, the target player is effected with Legacy Inhibition indefinitely and the Inhibitor breaks. When you right-click an Inhibitor Remote item, the target player is effected with 5 seconds
of Active Legacy Inhibition. You can do this indefinitely until the Inhibitor Remote breaks or the target player kills you.

### Chimaera

To command your Chimaera, choose commands on page 5, titled Chimaera, in the radial menu. **These modes can't be used simultaneously. Previous mode is automatically deselected when next mode is chosen. Activate these modes with right-click:**

- **Morph:**
  Right-click while looking at wolf (can be done from a distance) to cycle between forms, wolf -> parrot -> axolotl (with a bucket of tropical fish, used to make axolotl follow you) -> horse (with a saddle)-> wolf. **Be careful of turning Chimaera into parrot when badly hurt as forms share health.**

- **Mark Target:**
  Right-click while looking at target and wolf will attack it.

- **Call:**
  Right-click to tp all Chimaeras owned by you, to you. Doesn't work over long distances because Chimaeras' chunks get unloaded. For teleporting long distances, flying long distances with Avex and walking long distances, morph your Chimaera into a parrot and put it onto your shoulder.
