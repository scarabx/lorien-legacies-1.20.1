# About

This mod is based on the sci-fi book series of the same name by Pittacus Lore. By some it is also referred to as I Am Number Four. It's about 9 superpowered alien teenagers, Garde, that escaped from their planet, Lorien, when it was destroyed by the Mogadorians. They were bestowed Legacies which grant them superhuman abilities and sent to earth to prevent the Mogadorians from doing the same to earth.

## Manual

### Legacies

Superhuman abilities bestowed by the lifeforce (The Entity) of the destroyed planet, Lorien.

Stress points increase by one by hitting hostiles or by being hit by hostiles. There is a 33% chance that a random Legacy will be bestowed upon the player. A 5 minute cooldown before you can get another Legacy is activated after Legacy Bestowal.

Stress is accumulative and Legacy Bestowal only happens 33% of the time when stress points reach 100 or more. Stress resets on death or when reaching a maximum of 150.

**Legacy abilities are triggered with a radial menu which is opened with R key.
Radial Menu pages are cycled with shift key while the radial menu is open.** Fireball and Iceball Throwing, Sturma Lightning Strike and Telekinesis Push, Pull and Move are activated by the radial menu and triggered by left-click (Fireball, Iceball and Sturma Lightning Strike) or right-click (Telekinesis Pull and Push). **Right-click and left-click abilities automatically cancel each other out when selected. Non right-click and left-click abilities can be used simultaneously and right-click and left-click abilities can also be used simultaneously.**

**REFER TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE FOR TLDR**

Previous mode is automatically deselected when next mode is chosen. Activate these modes with right-click:**
